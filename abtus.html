V-PROTECT IS WEBSITE WHICH AIDS IN THE INTEGRATION OF NATION CYBERSECURITY.
IT PROVIDES 2 FEATURES:
<u>1.SECURITY TO YOUR ONLINE PROFILE</u>
"V-protect" can be used to guard your profile online.This website helps you to create a
 profile online.This website can be accessed by websites such as LinkedIn,Facebook,Quora,
Instagram,Naukri,Internshala etc.Insted of filling the details again in these social media 
websites,you can access ur information from you profile which you have created here.This
 feature is offered by Internet giant Google also.But Google notifies the user if they have 
logged in from another device.But no notification is provided if any other user has logged into 
this other user's account and has made any changes.By the time the user gets to know that change
has been made in his/her profile the change will be seen by other users and other websites and
 misinterpret the deeds about the owner about the profile.This can cause tarnishing of user's image
 in his domain.Misinterpretation of the user may lead to adverse consequences such as...the websites
which are accessing the users profile using V-protect can block theuser from using their website.So,
V protect is having a protection mechanism where 
"IF ANY CHANGE IS MADE IN USER'S PROFILE,THE USER WILL BE NOTIFIED VIA E-MAIL.
IF THE CHANGE IS MADE BY THE USER ITSELF,THE EMAIL IS IGNORED.
IF NOT,THE USER WILL TAKE SECURITY MEASURES LIKE CHNAGING HIS PASSWORD OR
 REPORTING IS TO THE CYBERSECURITY TEAM"


<u>2.ONLINE COUSELLING FOR CYBER CRIMES THROUGH CHAT BOT.</u>

may misunderstand them.so,"V-PROTECT" provides an online couseller through our chat-bot 
which is well programmed to understand the users threats and motive of the attacker through
 analysing the statements given by victim considering these statements as input.The counsellor 
also helps the victim in getting the courage to come out of their panics and approach the most
 reliable and promising government organisations and  NGO's.
